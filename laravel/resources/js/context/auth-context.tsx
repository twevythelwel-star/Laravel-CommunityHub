 * React state, hydrated it from localStorage, and matched login attempts against
 * a hardcoded object while ignoring the password. There is no client-side user
 * state any more: the server shares the authenticated user on every Inertia
 * response via App\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests, and this hook reads it.
 *
 * The `useAuth()` signature is kept so the 26 components that already call it
 * need no changes.
