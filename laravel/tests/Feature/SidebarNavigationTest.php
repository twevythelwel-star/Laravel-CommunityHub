/**
 * Every link the sidebar and the avatar menu offer must actually open.
 *
 * The nav, the route gates and the in-page role checks have drifted apart
 * repeatedly in this codebase, always in one of two directions: a menu item
 * that 403s when clicked, or a page reachable by URL that no menu offers. This
 * pins the first direction, which is the one a user meets as a broken link.
 *
 * Two defects this was written against, both in DashboardLayout's filter:
 *
 *   - Staff were short-circuited to a hardcoded [Profile, Gate Pass] before the
 *     `roles` arrays were consulted, so the deliberate addition of Staff to
 *     Notifications and Safety Alert — each carrying a comment explaining why
 *     Staff needed it — never reached a screen. Staff also had no link back to
 *     /dashboard, which is where sign-in lands them.
 *   - The Security branch recomputed the same filter and appended Profile "if
 *     missing", which it never was. A no-op guarding nothing.
 *
 * The map below is the contract. Change a `roles` array in
 * resources/js/Layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx and this must change with it.
