/**
 * Expires visitors who were expected but never checked in.
 *
 * This replaces the setInterval in src/app/dashboard/visitors/page.tsx, which
 * checked every 60 seconds for visitors more than 12 hours past their expected
 * time and dropped them from React state. Three problems with that:
 *
 *   - it only ran while somebody had the page open;
 *   - it removed rows from one browser's memory, so another user still saw them;
 *   - a genuinely stale pre-clearance stayed valid at the gate indefinitely.
 *
 * Expiry is now a scheduled server sweep, and the records are marked rather than
 * deleted so the history survives for audit.
