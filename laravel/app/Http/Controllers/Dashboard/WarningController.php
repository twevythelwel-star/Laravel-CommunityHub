/**
 * Backs src/app/dashboard/warnings/page.tsx — "Community Safety Alerts".
 *
 * What the original did not do:
 *
 *   1. "Send Alert" called console.log and toasted "Alert Sent".
 *   2. Confirm/deny were client-side counters. A vote never left the browser,
 *      reloading the page restored the mock tallies, and nothing stopped one
 *      person voting repeatedly. They are now one row per user per warning,
 *      enforced by a unique index on warning_responses.
 *
 * On who may raise an alert: an earlier revision of this controller gated
 * `store` on `manageSecurity`, which was wrong. The page is designed around
 * resident reports — the seeded authors are residents, the copy reads "Send and
 * validate urgent alerts within the community", and the dialog says the alert
 * goes "to all residents and the admin", so the sender is not the admin. The
 * confirm/deny mechanic only makes sense as community corroboration of an
 * unverified report; residents do not need to vote on an official security
 * bulletin. That gate was mine, not the original's, and it made the Send Alert
 * button 403 for exactly the people the feature was built for.
 *
 * Raising an alert notifies everyone, so it is rate limited on the route
 * (`throttle:3,60`) and `manageSecurity` can delete a false alarm.
