/**
 * Where one payment attempt stands. Enforced by Payment::transitionTo().
 *
 * Every state is one a real event can put a payment in — a processor's
 * webhook, or an administrator's action — never one only the browser knows.
 *
 * Processor payments (card through Stripe Checkout, or a future local PSP):
 *
 *     Created ─┬─► RequiresAction ─┬─► Processing ─► Succeeded ─► Paid
 *              │                   │                    ▲
 *              └─► Failed ◄────────┘                    │
 *                    │   (a declined card may be retried on the same
 *                    └── checkout page, so Failed can still succeed)
 *              Created / RequiresAction / Failed ─► Expired   (terminal)
 *
 * Office-confirmed payments (bank wire, cash, QR, NFC, digital wallets,
 * Zelle, Cash App — channels the app cannot see). Received is logged by one
 * administrator; Verified is set in a bank reconciliation by a different one:
 *
 *     Created ─► AwaitingTransfer ─► Received ─► Verified ─► Paid
 *            └───────────────┴─► Rejected   (terminal)
 *
 * After payment, for both:
 *
 *     Paid ─► PartiallyRefunded ─► Refunded
 *       └──► Disputed ─┬─► Paid          (dispute won)
 *                      └─► ChargedBack   (dispute lost, terminal)
 *
 * Succeeded and Paid differ on purpose: Succeeded is "the processor has the
 * money", Paid is "it was applied to what it was for". A payment for an
 * invoice already settled at the office stays Succeeded until refunded.
