/**
 * Payments the app cannot see: bank transfer, cash at the office, QR, NFC,
 * Apple/Google/Samsung Pay, Zelle and Cash App.
 *
 * One provider for all of them, because they work the same way: the payer
 * sends the money outside the app, one administrator logs it as received, a
 * different administrator verifies it in a bank reconciliation, and only then
 * is it applied (PaymentOrchestratorService::markReceived / verifyReceived).
 * What differs per channel — account details, instructions, surcharge — is
 * configured per channel in payment_channel_settings, not coded per class.
 *
 * No webhooks, no refunds through a processor, no links, no recurring: the
 * office handles those by hand, so this implements the core contract only.
